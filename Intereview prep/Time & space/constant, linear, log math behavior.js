our function depends on n

- constant function - simplest function we could design
- constant functions should not rely on their input
- constant functions the output does not depend on the input

function(n) = 1
input  output
 n      f(n)
 1        1
 2        1
 3        1
 4        1

our output is constantly 1


LINEAR functions
- whatever we give the function we get back the same thing
- our output relies on our input
- whenever we increase our input size we increase our output size

function(n) = n
input  output
 n      f(n)
 1        1
 2        2
 3        3
 4        4

function(n) = 3n
input  output
 n      f(n)
 1        3
 2        6
 3        9
 4        12

- we increase our input by 3 so our output increases by 3


LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS

exponentiation
2^5 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 32

LOG
2^5 = 32
log2(32) = 5 ... 2 to the what power will give you 32?
log2(16) = 4 .... 2 to the what power will give you 16?
log2(16) = 4 ... how many times do you need to divide 16 by 2 to get 1

log10(1000) = 3 ... 10 to the what power will give you 1000?


f(n) = log(n)
input  output

 n      f(n)
 1        0
 2        1
 4        2
 8        3
 16       4
 32       5
