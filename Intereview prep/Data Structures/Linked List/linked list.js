/*
like arrays a linked list is used to represent sequential data.

its a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement
in memory. unlike arrays where data is stored in sequential blocks of memory.

instead each element contains an address of the next element.

each node contains data and a reference to the next node

Advantages

insertion and deleton of a node are O(1)
- elements do not need to be shifted

disadvantages
access time is linear because we need to travserse from the start of the list to find a node.
we cannot key into the list ike we do arrays
