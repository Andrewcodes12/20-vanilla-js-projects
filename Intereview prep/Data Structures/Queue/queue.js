/*
queue is a linear collection of elements that can be modified by enqueing and dequeing.

elements are added to the back and removed from the front.

queus can be implemented using arrays or singly linked lists.


Time Complexity
enqueue - O(n)
dequeue - O(1)

enqueu using an array is O(n) because you need to shift every element
enqueue using a linkedList is O(1)
