// binary heap is a bianry tree but its not a BST


// Binary Heap(max)
//     100
//     / \
//    50  27
//    /\  /
// 32 42 24

// Max heap- a node will always be greater than its children


/*
Heaps are partially sorted
only thing we know with heaps is the root is the greatest node(max) or least node(min)
