/*
A heap is a specialized tree-based structure which is a complete tree

Max-Heap - in a max heap the value of a node must be greatest among the node values
in its entire subtree.

Min-Heap - in a min heap the value of the node must be the smallest among the node values
in its entire subtree.


Time complexity:
find max/min - O(1)
insert - O(logn)
remove - O(logn)
